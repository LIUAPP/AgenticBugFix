Bug reproduction steps
======================

Prereqs
-------
* Python 3.10+

Steps
-----
1. From the repo root, run `python -m app.cli.main`.
2. Observe that the CLI lists three day summaries. The first day (monday) is correct.
3. The second/third days show inflated counts/averages (they include previous days).

Expected
--------
Each day should be summarized independently (count 3, averages 6.0 and 9.0 for tuesday/wednesday).

Actual
------
Later days include earlier values because `app/core/processor.py:15` uses a mutable default list (`history=[]`),
so state leaks across calls.
